A MelonLoader mod for Schedule I that automates inventory management for dealers. When dealers run low on product, they'll automatically travel to their assigned storage, collect suitable items, and return to their position.

## Features

- **Storage Assignment System**: Assign dealers to specific storage locations through an intuitive UI
- **Automated Inventory Monitoring**: Dealers automatically track their inventory levels and restock when below 40% capacity
- **Smart Collection Logic**: Dealers only collect items they can actually sell
- **Realistic Travel Simulation**: Travel time based on distance between dealer and storage location
- **Dealer Notifications**: Receive text messages from dealers when they collect items or find empty storage
- **Balanced Gameplay**: Each dealer can only be assigned to one storage to maintain game balance

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) installed (version 0.7 or higher)
2. Download the latest release of Dealer Auto-Resupply System from the [Releases](https://github.com/KaiNoodles/DealerAutoResupply/releases) page
3. Place the `DealerAutoResupply.dll` file in your Schedule I game folder under `\Mods\`
4. Launch the game with MelonLoader

## How to Use

### Assigning a Dealer to Storage

1. Open any storage container in the game
2. Look for the new panel on the right side of the storage menu
3. Click on "No Dealer" or the currently assigned dealer's name
4. Select a dealer from the popup menu
5. The dealer will now be associated with this storage location

### Removing a Dealer Assignment

1. Open the storage container
2. Click the "Clear" button in the dealer assignment panel

### How It Works

- Dealers periodically check their inventory (every 30 seconds by default)
- If a dealer's inventory falls below 40% capacity, they'll begin the collection process
- The dealer will "travel" to the storage location (simulated based on distance)
- Once there, they'll collect items they can sell (up to 75% of their empty slots)
- After collection, they'll "travel" back to their position
- You'll receive a text message from the dealer informing you of their success or failure

## Planned Features

- Configuration options to adjust collection thresholds and intervals
- Option to enable/disable dealer text messages
- Priority system for dealers to favor certain products
